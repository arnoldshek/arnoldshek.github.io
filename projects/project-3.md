summary: A prototype for a medicine dispenser I did for my EE296 project. 
---

As a Computer/Electrical Engineering student, we are required to do projects every year. For my sophomore level project, I was tasked to create something innovative or useful to everyday life utilizing an arduino uno. For my project, I came up with an medicine dispenser which would dispense medication at certain times which could be set by an android app. The app could set the number of pills dispensed, when to dispense them, and can notify you when you need to take your medication.

For this project, I worked alongside a partner. I was in charge of selecting the components and coding the communication protocol between the android app and the arduino. They communicated via bluetooth. I was also in charge of creating the android app which was created using MIT's AppInventor.
