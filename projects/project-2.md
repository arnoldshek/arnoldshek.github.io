FIRST Robotics is a robotics competition tailored toward High School students. Robot complexit goes far beyond a high school student's capability which allows for teams to find engineering mentors to learn from. In high school, I participated in FIRST Robotics and was inspired by my team's mentors to pursue engineering and to one day be able to inspire others as they have inspired me. 

Mentors on the team learn alongside the students. Building the robot and competing is basically one big project that requires design, planning, budgetting, troubleshooting, etc. My role on the team I mentor is to assist with the design process, to assist the Electrical sub-team with troubleshooting, and to teach the students the necessary skills to assist with the robot. These skills include programming, logic, wiring, soldering, etc. In addition to this, I assist with strategy and scouting which are needed for competition.
